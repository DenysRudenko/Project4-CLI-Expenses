Why is it important to have login area?
Logging in to a website is important for several reasons:

Personalization: When you log in, the website can personalize the experience for you. It can remember your preferences, display content relevant to your interests, and provide a customized user interface.

Security: Logging in provides an additional layer of security for both you and the website. By requiring a username and password, the website can ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information or functions.

Access to restricted content or features: Some websites offer premium content or features that are only available to registered users. By logging in, you can gain access to these exclusive features.

Tracking and analytics: When you log in, the website can track your activity and behavior on the site. This information can be used to improve the user experience, analyze user behavior, and make data-driven decisions.

Overall, logging in to a website can enhance your experience, provide additional security, and unlock access to exclusive content or features.

### Login

After successfull registration, user will receive an confirmation email, to follow the instuctions.

### Main page

After succesfull login user can interact with a website. He can create expenses, income , edit them, delete them, and count how much he spend by the group and categories with additional information. It`s really important to keep on track on counting you budget.

### Model Graph

A model graph, also known as a computational graph, is a way of representing a mathematical model or algorithm as a directed graph, where nodes represent mathematical operations and edges represent the flow of data between those operations. Model graphs are commonly used in machine learning to represent neural networks and other types of models.

Model graphs can be helpful in a number of ways:

Visualization: Model graphs provide a visual representation of the model or algorithm, which can help researchers and engineers better understand how the model works and identify areas for improvement.

Debugging: When a model is not performing as expected, a model graph can help pinpoint where errors are occurring by tracing the flow of data through the graph.

Optimization: By analyzing a model graph, researchers can identify parts of the model that are computationally expensive and optimize those parts to improve performance.

Deployment: Model graphs can be used to deploy models to production systems, such as mobile devices or cloud servers, by converting the graph to a format that can be executed efficiently on those systems.
